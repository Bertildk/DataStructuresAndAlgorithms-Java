Linked Lists, is a Linear data structure where elements are called nodes. Which are connected together using pointers.
Each node has at a minimum a data which is the value stored, and a Pointer which is the reference or adress to the next node in the List.

Types of Linked Lists:

Singly Linked Lists
    Each node only points to the next node.
    Last node is Null

Doublly Linked Lists
    Each node points to the previous and the next node.
    Allows traversal in both directions
Circular Linked Lists
    Can be both doubly or singly
    The last node points to the first node. 

Linked lists vs Array
Arrays are fixed sizes, with fast random access O(1) access. 
Linked lists are scattered in memory, they have a dynamic size, but access is slower O(n) to access each node. 

the HEAD of a Linked list refers to the first value of the List. 

Rule of Thumb:
    Use ArrayList when you need fast lookups and fewer modifications.
    Use LinkedList when you need lots of insertions/removals, especially at the head or tail.
